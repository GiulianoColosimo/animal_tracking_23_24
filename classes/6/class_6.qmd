## Linking movement and environment

The following slides were prepared by [Björn Reineking](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bjoern-Reineking), distributed via AniMove, and adapted for this course 

- Predict (possibly for new environmental conditions)
    - Movement paths (only SSF)
    - Utilization distributions
- Understand
    - How the environment (resources such as food, risks such as predation, conditions such as temperature) shapes movement paths and long-term utilization distributions (as a function of animal characteristics such as size, sex, diet)
    - Quantify effect of drivers

## Model the probability of presence in a certain area

- Resource selection functions (RSF)
    - Predicts occurrence distribution (fraction of time the animal spends at a given site)
    - Assumes positions are statistically independent
- Step selection functions (SSF)
    - Predicts position at time t + Δt based on current position
    - Assumes velocities of successive steps are independent
    - Can simulate trajectories
    - More difficult to get predictions of utilisation distributions
    
Both RSF and SSF model the probability of presence in a given area based on the environment and spatial constraints

## 

- RSF assumes that successive positions are independent
- Autocorrelation can be accounted for!
- effective sample sizes are in general much lower than the number of tracking points

- SSF predicts the probability of the animal’s next position based on its current position (and bearing) and environmental conditions

- Movement is discrete in time, with a single fixed time step length (e.g. 4 hours)
- Successive steps are stochastically independent (potentially accounting for direction of last step) (no autocorrelation in velocities)
