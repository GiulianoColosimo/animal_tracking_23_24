    "text": "Introduction\nWelcome to class! These web-pages contain all the information you need to accomplish your class work for Animal-Tracking nella Biologia della Conservazione (2023-2024).\n\n\n\nGeneral information\nThis is an discretionary course for master level students enrolled in the “Biologia Evoluzionistica, Ecologia e Antropologia Applicata” (BEEA) degree at the University of Rome Tor Vergata. It is worth 2 CFU for a total of 16 hours (i.e., 8 classes of 2 hours each) to be administered in person or remotely using Teams during the second semester of academic year 2023/2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs attendance is mandatory I will work with enrolled students to find the best time and day so that all can follow the class in person! If needed, we will change the delivery and we could make the class on-line using the Teams platform.\n\n\n\n\n\nTentative schedule. This may change after coordinating with the students on the best time/day for classes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay\nTime\nLocation\n\n\n\n\nLectures\nTo be decided\nTo be decided\nAula centro studi pesca/Teams\n\n\nFinal exam\nTo be decided\nTo be decided\nAula centro studi pesca/Teams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse language\nThe course will be thought in Italian unless international students are present. In this latter case the course will be thought in English. All the material and the literature used (including this website!) will be in English.\n\n\nPre-requisites\nThis is an introductory course, so no prior knowledge of this topic is required. Throughout the course students will be extensively exposed to various software and web-tools. All software used is freely available. It is necessary that each student has his/her own laptop in order to better follow the various demonstrations/exercises presented throughout the course. Problem-solving skills and a good knowledge of your own computer OS structure and function will definitely be useful. This course does not teach you system administration skills and you should know how to read help files and software guides, as well as retrieve information on-line. Should a student not have a portable computer, all code, demonstrations, and class slides will be uploaded to this website and are available for practice on a desktop computer.\n\n\nTextbook\nAs this is an introductory and discretionary course there is no textbook. All the material covered in class will be available to you on this website. Most of the readings you will be doing is based on peer-reviewed manuscripts published on various scientific journals. Still, if you are really interested in this topic a really good, and advanced book is Guisan, Thuiller, & Zimmermann (2020). As this course will heavily rely on the use of R and R-Studio I am adding here some very useful resources that I encourage to use.\n\nCRAN\nStackOverflow\nBioconductor\nUn Viaggio nell’Ambiente R\n\n\n\nLearning objectives\nThe course aims to train students in the techniques of acquisition, organization, and analysis of data for the long-term tracking and monitoring of animals for conservation purposes. The course offers an overview of the different types of marking and tracking techniques used to monitor wildlife, and promotes an understanding of the best ways to use them in relation to the specific question that needs answer or hypothesis that needs testing. We will cover some of the most important methodologies used to analyse tracking data (for example, the estimation of distribution ranges) and peak in to some of the more advanced data analysis procedures (for example, animal distribution modeling). Through the review of the scientific literature and the discussion of the different animal monitoring techniques and analytical protocols, the course participants will develop the necessary critical skills for understanding the various problems related to the acquisition and organization of time series of data for animal tracking.\n\n\nClass evaluation\nAt the end of the course students will be evaluated on the presentation of a small project that they will undertake throughout the course. We will be reading and discussing primary literature on Movement Ecology. The critical comparison of the various methodologies of data acquisition, organization and processing will constitute the basis for the formulation of the student’s final judgment. Aspects that will be used to assess students’ learning level are their participation and interaction during the course and their ability to present and discuss scientific literature articles.\n\n\nMeeting hours\nEvery student is encouraged to contact me by e-mail with questions, doubts, curiosities about this course. My office hours are between 10:00 and 12:00 every Wednesday. My office is number 14, located on the first floor of the main building at “Laboratori di Ecologia Sperimentale ed Acquacoltura” (see the Contact tab for a map with the location of the office). It is always a good idea to e-mail me before coming to the office, to prevent overcrowding.\n\n\nStudents with disabilities\nPlease, let me know if you require special accommodations to follow this class.\n\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nThe success of this class depends on all of us creating a safe environment where students feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. We should all strive to be respectful and supportive of one another during class discussions. This class is made better by the contribution of diverse perspectives, and I hope that our class conversations can reflect that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nGuisan, A., Thuiller, W., & Zimmermann, N.

It is a rather important component of tracking, especially when dealing with animals that move significant distances.\nOne of the main issue is that ultimately what we try to do is to represent locations measured on a 3D surface (the earth) to a 2D map. This introduces distortions and errors.\nAnother issue is represented by the fact that the earth is not smooth surface. We can visualize the problem here!\nWe recognize two big classes of coordinate systems:\n\n\n\n\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\nThe earth is represented by a spherical or ellipsoidal surface. The geometric representation of the earth that is used is called datum. Distances between points cannot be measured out with geographical coordinates.\nLatitude: denoted by the Greek letter phi (𝜙). It is given as an angle that ranges from −90° at the south pole to 90° at the north pole, with 0° at the Equator.\nLongitude: denoted by the Greek letter lambda (λ). It is given as an angle that ranges from -180° to 180° from east to west and the 0°.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAngles (degrees; longitude and latitude), pointing out locations on a spherical or ellipsoidal surface.

    "text": "Telemetry e GPS\n\n\n\nThe term telemetry (𝛕𝛈𝛌𝛆 = far, 𝛍𝛆𝛕𝛒𝛐𝛎 = measurement) refers to an ensemble of techniques that allow to retrieve real time data and information using an array of wireless data transfer protocols.\nThe acronym GPS stands for Global Positioning System GPS\n\nNAVSTAR = NAVigation System with Timing And Ranging\nn ≥ 4 satellites\nm ≥ 1 receivers\nPseudo-ranges\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSatellite constellation serving the GPS system. Image source\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does positioning with range works?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you know, distance is a function of time and speed. We can assume with a certain degree of confidence that the speed of our radio signal is fairly constant (\\(3*10^5\\)Km/s). If our estimate of time is error-prone, the associated estimate of distance may also be affected by errors. That is why the distance is actually called pseudo-distance.\nTo minimize this error a forth reference point (satellite) is necessary!\nThe GPS receiver knows the position of the satellite because it is the satellite itself that sends it by communicating its orbit in a navigation message (ephemeris)."

A unique event ID is assigned to every time-location or other time-measurement record in Movebank. If multiple measurements are included within a single row of a data file, they will share an event ID. If users import the same sensor measurement to Movebank multiple times, a separate event ID will be assigned to each.

Allowed values are TRUE or FALSE. Values are calculated automatically, with TRUE indicating the event has not been flagged as an outlier by 'algorithm marked outlier', 'import marked outlier' or 'manually marked outlier', or that the user has overridden the results of these outlier attributes using 'manually marked valid' = TRUE.

The speed accuracy estimate (better named 'inaccuracy estimation') may show very high values, since the GPS module calculates a very conservative value. These speed measurements are potentially very inaccurate when interpreting the data (definition from e-obs Digital Telemetry Manual for DataDecoder Software, 2010; Franz Kuemmeth, e-obs Digital Telemetry, personal communication, 2012).

All sensors are associated with a tag id, and tags can contain multiple sensor types. Each event record in Movebank is assigned one sensor type. If values from multiple sensors are reported in a single event, the primary sensor is used. Values are chosen from a controlled list: acceleration = The sensor collects acceleration data; accessory-measurements = The sensor collects accessory measurements, such as battery voltage; acoustic-telemetry = The sensor transmits an acoustic signal that is detected by receivers to determine location; argos-doppler-shift = The sensor location is estimated by Argos using Doppler shift; barometer = The sensor records air or water pressure; bird-ring = The animal is identified by a band or ring that has a unique identifier; derived = Information is derived from other sensor data; geolocation-api = The location is determined based on detection by nearby cell towers or other wireless network connectors using the World Wide Web Consortium Geolocation API Recommendation; gnss = The sensor uses one or more global navigation satellite systems to determine location; gps = The sensor uses GPS to determine location; gyroscope = The sensor records angular velocity; heart-rate = The sensor records or is used to calculate heart rate; magnetometer = The sensor records the magnetic field; natural-mark = The animal is identified by a unique natural marking; orientation = Quaternion components describing the orientation of the tag are derived from accelerometer and gyroscope measurements; proximity = The sensor identifies proximity to other tags; radio-transmitter = The sensor transmits a radio signal that is detected by receivers to determine location; sigfox-geolocation = The sensor location is determined by Sigfox using the received signal strength indicator; solar-geolocator = The sensor collects light levels, which are used to determine position (for processed locations); solar-geolocator-raw = The sensor collects light levels, which are used to determine position (for raw light-level measurements); solar-geolocator-twilight = The sensor collects light levels, which are used to determine position (for twilights calculated from light-level measurements).

If the species name can not be provided, this should be the lowest level taxonomic rank that can be determined and that is used in the ITIS taxonomy.

It is worth 2 CFU for a total of 16 hours to be administered in person\nThe course will be thought in Italian unless international students are present. In this latter case the course will be thought in English. All the material and the literature used will be in English\nNo specific prior knowledge of is required, but rudiments of basic GIS will definitely help. Students will be extensively exposed to various software and web-tools. Problem-solving skills and a good knowledge of your own computer OS structure and function will definitely be useful\nClasses are Tuesday and Thursday (14:00-16:00) in “Aula centro studi pesca” (Laboratori di Ecologia Sperimentale ed Acquacoltura).\nAt the end of the course you will be evaluated with a written exam."
